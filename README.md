### Dot matrix controller: MAX7219
The MAX7219/MAX7221 are compact, serial input/output common-cathode display drivers that interface
microprocessors (µPs) to 7-segment numeric LED displays of up to 8 digits, bar-graph displays, or 64 individual LEDs. Included on-chip are a BCD code-B
decoder, multiplex scan circuitry, segment and digit
drivers, and an 8x8 static RAM that stores each digit.
Only one external resistor is required to set the segment current for all LEDs. The MAX7221 is compatible
with SPI™, QSPI™, and MICROWIRE™, and has slewrate-limited segment drivers to reduce EMI.

### The main controller: Arduino NANO equipped with Atmega328
Arduino NANO is a compact microelectronic prototyping platform designed for use with a breadboard.
The basis of the Arduino Nano is an ATmega328-based microcontroller, a logic chip for processing data with a clock frequency of 16 MHz, which has 8 analog and 14 general-purpose digital pins on board, as well as all the necessary interfaces: I2C, SPI and UART.
